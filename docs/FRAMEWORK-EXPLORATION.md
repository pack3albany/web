# Framework & Platform Exploration Log

Running log of what we've explored for the Pack 3 site, the requirements driving
those choices, and where things stand. Discussion notes, dead ends and open
questions belong here; individual POC folders keep the how-to details.

## Requirements

What the site actually needs — every evaluation below is measured against these:

- **Static brochure site.** 3 pages (Home, Join, Calendar), Google Forms + Google
  Calendar embeds, ~25 photos. No accounts, no data of our own.
- **Hosting: GitHub Pages — decided.** `.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes the
  site folder on push to `main`. No server to patch, no monthly cost.
  Squarespace/Wix are out (see below).
- **Editing without a developer** (original goal): a pack volunteer should be able
  to change text and photos. Two shapes were explored: a CMS form UI, or editing
  the HTML/partials in git. Not settled yet.
- **Local editing and full preview.** Work on the site locally and see the whole
  thing while editing; live reload preferred.
- **Hand-written HTML, not markdown.** The pages are HTML templates; no content
  model or markdown authoring is required.
- **Repeatability.** Builds and checks should be runnable scripts, not eyeballing
  (`npm run check`, parity tests, screenshots).

## Where it stands (2026-09-17)

- **Deployed source:** `site/` (design 6) via GitHub Pages.
- **Build tool:** **Eleventy** (Nunjucks templates) with shared header/footer
  partials — demonstrated by two POCs: the pagescms build (now its own repo,
  `jonocodes/troop3-pagescms`) and `poc/eleventy/`.
- **Pages CMS POC promoted to its own repo and deployed.** The pagescms build was
  extracted to a standalone repo — [`github.com/jonocodes/troop3-pagescms`](https://github.com/jonocodes/troop3-pagescms)
  — with the Eleventy site hoisted to the **repo root** so `.pages.yml` sits where
  Pages CMS expects it (root of the connected repo). It builds+verifies in CI and
  deploys to GitHub Pages at <https://jonocodes.github.io/troop3-pagescms/>. The
  `poc/pagescms/` folder here is now just a pointer to that repo.
- **Open:** which Eleventy build becomes canonical, whether Pages deploys a built
  `_site/` instead of the site folder, and what the owner's editing surface is.

## Options explored

### Ruled out

- **Squarespace / Wix** — closed platforms: no import/API/CLI, so the site can only
  be built by clicking in an editor; custom CSS/scripts need the ~$33/mo Business
  plan. The build labour lands on us either way, and a static repo site is free and
  automatable. See `docs/PLATFORM-DECISION.md` (historical) and
  `docs/SQUARESPACE-GUIDE-NO-CSS.md`, which is now a dead end.
- **Runtime JS "components" in the browser** (native web components, Preact + htm,
  Alpine, petite-vue, fetch-based partials) — would share the header/footer without
  a build, but nav/footer then exist only after JS runs: no-JS users and some
  crawlers see nothing, and content flashes/shifts on load. On GitHub Pages a build
  step is free, so the output should stay plain HTML. Not built; discussed only.
- **React (or any SPA framework)** — the early `design-ideas/` prototypes were
  React and were flattened back to static HTML; no dynamic app needs live here.

### Built as POCs

| Option | What it is | Outcome |
|--------|------------|---------|
| `poc/wordpress-acf/` | WordPress + ACF, full site, owner edits in wp-admin | Works and is fully editable, but needs PHP + MariaDB hosting and ongoing WP/plugin patching |
| `poc/grav/` | Flat-file PHP CMS, no database | Lighter than WordPress, but still a server; editing UX proven for a hero slice only |
| `poc/sveltia/` | Eleventy site + git-based CMS (Sveltia UI, Decap proxy) | No server; edits JSON via forms; requires content modeling per section. Local editing: Sveltia uses the File System Access API, Decap keeps a proxy; multi-device needs GitHub OAuth |
| `poc/pagescms/` → `jonocodes/troop3-pagescms` | Eleventy site + Pages CMS; edits the **HTML partials** in a web code editor | No content modeling, but the editor still faces HTML; the CMS itself is a Next.js + Postgres app (hosted app is the sane path). Promoted to its own repo, deployed to GitHub Pages, with a smoke-test `check` in CI |
| `poc/eleventy/` | Templating only: full site as an Eleventy build with shared partials | Proves header/footer/scripts (125 duplicated lines) collapse to one copy with identical output; self-contained assets; `npm run check`. Overlaps heavily with the pagescms build |

### Compared, not built

- **Eleventy vs Hugo** for the build step. Eleventy won because the pages are raw
  HTML: `.html` files are treated as templates as-is (Liquid by default, Nunjucks
  configured), so the diff is "replace header markup with an include". Hugo is a
  single binary but assumes content files wrapped by layouts, and its Go templates
  are more machinery than 3 static pages need.
- **Jekyll** — GitHub Pages can build it natively, but the repo deploys via Actions
  already, and Ruby tooling is a heavier local ask than Node.
- **WordPress theme without ACF** — superseded and archived at
  `archive/wordpress-theme-hardcoded` (see `docs/ARCHIVES.md`).

## Findings that keep coming up

- **Owner editing is the expensive axis, not hosting.** Every CMS option pays the
  same per-section wiring cost; the cheaper options (Sveltia, Pages CMS) push that
  cost onto the person editing instead (forms need a schema; Pages CMS edits HTML).
- **Two editing archetypes:** content-model CMS (WordPress, Grav — forms, needs
  schema) vs code editor over partials (Sveltia, Pages CMS — no schema, needs
  HTML literacy). Static hosting rules out nothing either way.
- **Templating is a prerequisite** for any CMS: one header/footer/scripts partial
  set, verified by a build check. Done in both Eleventy POCs.
- **Verification matters:** both POCs ship `npm run check`; the first Eleventy POC
  also asserted byte-parity with the deployed pages (whitespace-normalized, two
  documented normalizations).
- **GitHub Pages constraints:** static files only, no server-side includes or
  redirects; every build happens in Actions, so any tool that emits static files
  is viable.

## Editing surface: Pages CMS vs editing HTML directly in GitHub

With the pagescms POC deployed, a concrete question surfaced: since we chose **raw
HTML editing** (no content fields in `.pages.yml`), how much easier is Pages CMS
for a low-tech pack volunteer than just editing the `.html` files in GitHub's web
UI? They're closer than the Pages CMS pitch implies — because both put a **code
editor over the raw HTML file**, the core risk is identical.

**Same in both** (a consequence of the no-fields choice, not the tool):

- The user sees the full HTML: tags, `{% ... %}` template syntax, `class="..."`.
- They can safely change words/links/dates — and can just as easily break markup.
- Save triggers a commit, which fires the deploy.

**Where Pages CMS is genuinely easier:**

- **Curated file list.** `.pages.yml` shows ~7 friendly-labelled entries ("Home",
  "Footer", "Header + mobile menu") in a sidebar; GitHub makes them navigate
  `src/pages/…` and `src/_includes/…` and know which file is which.
- **No git vocabulary.** Save = done. GitHub's web editor exposes "commit changes",
  commit messages, and branches/PRs if `main` is protected.
- **Fewer wrong turns.** They can't wander into `dev/`, config, or workflows, or
  delete files; GitHub exposes the whole repo.
- **Nicer editor + media picker** for `src/images` (from the `media:` line).
- **No GitHub dashboard** to navigate.

**Where GitHub is actually easier:**

- **Zero setup** — no app to install, no Postgres, no hosted-account onboarding.
- **One less service** to trust/maintain.
- GitHub's web editor also has syntax highlighting (and `.` → `github.dev`).

**Bottom line.** For a non-technical editor doing occasional word/date/link tweaks,
Pages CMS is meaningfully gentler — mostly the curated list, no git words, and the
can't-wander guardrails. It's "similar" in the way that matters most (they still
see HTML), but the labelled sidebar and guardrails are a real reduction in "what do
I click / what did I just break" anxiety. To genuinely cross from "easier" to
"can't break the markup" needs **content fields / visual editing** (CloudCannon,
TinaCMS) — the structured-field approach this POC deliberately avoided.

**Cheap middle option (not yet built):** split the truly-editable bits (pack name,
meeting times, dates, join link) into a small **data file with real fields** in
`.pages.yml`, keep the HTML partials for a developer. The editor then gets safe
form inputs for the 90% they touch and never opens raw HTML.

## Open questions

- Which editing UX will the pack actually accept — CMS forms, or a code editor?
  (See "Editing surface" above: for raw-HTML editing, Pages CMS is gentler than
  GitHub's web UI but not fundamentally safer. Worth prototyping the data-file +
  fields "middle option" before deciding?)
- Which build is canonical: the pagescms build (`jonocodes/troop3-pagescms`,
  CMS-ready, deployed) or `poc/eleventy/`
  (templating-only), or do both stay as comparisons?
- Do we switch `pages.yml` to build and publish `_site/`, and does the deployed
  site folder stay in the loop as the source of page bodies?
- If Pages CMS: use the hosted app (app.pagescms.org); local self-hosting hit
  GitHub App manifest bugs in pages-cms 2.1.8 (`dev/patches/` in the standalone
  `jonocodes/troop3-pagescms` repo).
- If Sveltia: multi-device editing needs the GitHub backend + OAuth worker; local
  editing is same-machine only.
